Event planner for lab two!!

Lab 4:
- Simlple factory pattern
  * Created a new class called EventFactory
  * The class has two methods, one returning a meeting and one returning a deadline
  * These methods are then used in the AddEventModal under their jbutton action listeners
  * This pattern is simple but great for encapsulation.
